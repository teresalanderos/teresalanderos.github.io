      <description>Learning about Python Learning about Python in my computational statistics course was my first introduction to the platform and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised to find out it wasn&#39;t as bad as people made it out to be. I still personally enjoy using R studio over Python, but I may just be a little biased since I started this coding journey on the R platform. It is interesting to see however, that Python is capable of doing a majority of the work that R can do and sometimes even more.</description>
