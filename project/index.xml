      <description>Inroduction The two datasets I have chosen involve taking a deeper look into the music industry. The first dataset, spotify_songs, is a dataset that contains information from an experiment conducted by, Kaylin Pavlik. She used the spotifyr package to collect about 5000 songs from 5 main categories (EDM, Latin, Pop, R&amp;amp;B, Rap, &amp;amp; Rock). The dataset contains variables such as the artist name, track name/album name, genre, song popularity, and 12 quantitative audio features for each track.</description>
