#Learning about Python

Learning about Python in my computational statistics course was my first introduction to the platform and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised to find out it wasn't as bad as people made it out to be. I still personally enjoy using R studio over Python, but I may just be a little biased since I started this coding journey on the R platform. It is interesting to see however, that Python is capable of doing a majority of the work that R can do and sometimes even more. 

##Python and R Studio
One of the things I found particularly interesting is the ability for the two platforms to communicate! Say for instance you want to grab a data set that is already installed in R, but you want to be able to easily learn more about the data set using Python. Well I have the perfect solution for you!

Go ahead and load the reticulate package and grab the data set of your interest
```{R}
library(reticulate)
quakes <- quakes
```

Now, try getting some of the summary statistics using python with the data set you pulled from R....go ahead, there's nothing to be afraid of, I promise this works!
```{python}
import numpy as np
r.quakes.describe() 
```

Another cool trick in Python is indexing a data frame. Say we only want to look at the variables long, lat, and depth in the quakes data set from R. Say no more!
```{python}
r.quakes[["long", "lat", "depth"]]
```

Not only can we pull data sets from R and use Python functions on them, but we could also do it the other way around. Check this out, we are going to make a graph using R studio's ggplot function using a data set from Python.
```{python}
import seaborn as sns
penguins=sns.load_dataset('penguins') 
df=penguins
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot()+geom_point(aes(py$df$bill_length_mm,py$df$body_mass_g))
```

The world becomes our oyster with the ability to communicate between R and Python, at least in the coding world. Now instead of battling between the two platforms, we can have the best of both worlds :)
