      <description>Learning about Python Learning about Python in my computational statistics course was my first introduction to the platform and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised to find out it wasn&#39;t as bad as people made it out to be. I still personally enjoy using R studio over Python, but I may just be a little biased since I started this coding journey on the R platform. It is interesting to see however, that Python is capable of doing a majority of the work that R can do and sometimes even more.</description>

      <description>Inroduction The two datasets I have chosen involve taking a deeper look into the music industry. The first dataset, spotify_songs, is a dataset that contains information from an experiment conducted by, Kaylin Pavlik. She used the spotifyr package to collect about 5000 songs from 5 main categories (EDM, Latin, Pop, R&amp;amp;B, Rap, &amp;amp; Rock). The dataset contains variables such as the artist name, track name/album name, genre, song popularity, and 12 quantitative audio features for each track.</description>

      <description>Introduction The dataset I have chosen takes a look into the effects of individuals with an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The dataset summarizes several clinical and one laboratory variable of 113 patients with an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The variables consist of measuring the Glasgow Outcome Score at 6 months (GOS6), outcome of the patient, gender, age, the World Federation of Neurological Surgeons score (WFNS), S100 Calcium Binding Protein B (S100B) concentrations, and Nucleoside diphosphate kinase A (NDKA) concentrations.</description>
